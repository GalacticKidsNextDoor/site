# Galactic Kids Next Door

_for earth_

_the world as our desktop_

The **_Galactic Kids Next Door_** is a movement dedicated to:

1. ending gun violence, especially towards children, in North America, and
2. fostering  communities of technologists and creatives through immersive programming.

Produced by [@ceo.hov](https://instagram.com/ceo.hov) for the [@House of Venus](https://tiktok.com/@houseofvenn.us) this platform connects online creators and startups to DARIA, the swarm AI maintained by the House of Venus.

Members can use apps to create singular products or experiences by purchasing tokens and using them to pay for apps that require them.

Those who want to create can subscribe for developer access as a Creator (for individuals) or Enterprise (for businesses) and receive an unlimited amount of tokens along with developer access to DARIA.

Lyoko is the development environment/interface for DARIA. It manages multimodal queries from Members and processes them appropriately using a variety of modules including Falcon-40B for reasoning and House Vision for computer vision.
